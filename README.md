# webfishing-midi
cross-platform midi player for the webfishing guitar!\
**Warning** ⚠️: the code may or may not be slop, I am not experienced with midi format

## Installation & Usage
Linux users may need additional runtime dependencies see [here](https://github.com/enigo-rs/enigo?tab=readme-ov-file#runtime-dependencies) and [here](https://github.com/nashaofu/xcap/?tab=readme-ov-file#linux-system-requirements)\
Windows users may need to install Microsoft [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)
- Download the executable for your platform from [here](https://github.com/yobson1/webfishing-midi/releases)
- Place your midi files in the `./midi` directory next to the executable
- Run webfishing-midi
- Select a song by typing a name to search and/or using the arrow keys & enter to make a selection
- Tab over to the game and press backspace to start playing
- Press right shift to pause/resume playing
- Press escape to stop playing

### Interface
The program uses a simple terminal interface powered by [dialoguer](https://github.com/console-rs/dialoguer) you can select a midi by typing a name to search and using the arrow keys & enter to make a selection.

#### Track selection
When selecting a track you can use the arrow keys to navigate and space to select. Enter to confirm your selection.\
If a track has all of it's fields as "Unknown" it is likely a meta track that has no notes and just meta messages for things like tempo changes.

## Supported platforms
As of now this has only been tested on Linux and Windows but I have taken care to use cross-platform libraries. If you encounter a problem please [open an issue](https://github.com/yobson1/webfishing-midi/issues) and I will try to resolve it

## Building
### Installing Rust
To build from source you will need to install Rust. Some Linux distros may provide a rust package directly but rustup is recommended, distros may also have a package for rustup.
[General instructions for installing rust can be found here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

- Install rustup using your Linux distribution's package manager or using [the install script](https://rustup.rs/). On Windows download and run [rustup-init.exe](https://rustup.rs/)
- Install the stable toolchain & set it as default with `rustup default stable`
- You can now build the project using `cargo build`

#### Example installation for Arch
```
$ sudo pacman -S rustup
$ rustup default stable
```

### Example
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yobson1/webfishing-midi.git
$ cd webfishing-midi
$ cargo build --release
```
